# FITeagle Intercloud

Intercloud project implementing simplified functionalities of IEEE P2303 Intercloud draft Standard
This is the source code of all the components in the Intercloud project

## Prerequisite
Deploy FITeagle platform according to https://github.com/FITeagle/bootstrap/README.md

## Download the intercloud code
```
git clone https://github.com/FITeagle/intercloud.git
```

## Start J2EE Server
```
./bootstrap/fiteagle.sh startJ2EE
```
Keep the J2EE Server running
## Start XMPP Server
Open a new terminal and start XMPP server 
```
./bootstrap/fiteagle.sh startXMPP
```
Keep the XMPP server running
##Compile and Deploy root and gateway
Relocate into the intercloud folder and use the following command
```
mvn clean test wildfly:deploy
```

##Check the function of the root and gateway
Open web site for root
```
http://localhost:8080/root/ 
```
and for gateway 
```
http://localhost:8080/gateway/ 
```
##Take use of the deployed intercloud infrastructure

There is already deployed infrastructure for one root and two gateways Alice and Bob.

To visit the root, open web page

```
http://root-intercloud.av.tu-berlin.de/root/
```

To visit the gateway Alice and Bob

```
http://alice-gw-intercloud.av.tu-berlin.de/gateway/login.html
```
```
http://bob-gw-intercloud.av.tu-berlin.de/gateway/login.html
```

For login in the gateway, use

```
username:alice
password:alice
```
for gateway alice, and

```
username:bob
password:bob
```
for gateway bob

After login, two functions of the gateway can be tested.

With the "Add Resource" function, a new node with relevant geograghical information can be added.

With the "Query Resource" function, resources hosted on the root can be queried with SPARQL. 

![](https://raw.github.com/FITeagle/intercloud/master/image/rootSPARQL.png)

Try the following SPARQL query:

```
SELECT ?s ?p ?o
FROM <http://root-intercloud.av.tu-berlin.de:3030/IaaS/data?default>
WHERE { ?s ?p ?o }
LIMIT 10
```
A same query function is also provided on the root side.

But to query the resources, a web GUI LodLive is also available on the root side with the following link

```
http://root-intercloud.av.tu-berlin.de/root/gui/lodlive/
```

Choose the example-IEEE Intercloud Testbed to provision the testbed

And get the resource demonstrated after start

The specific information aout all the components and their geographical position can be checked through the GUI

##Check the XMPP clients status on XMPP server of OpenFire
Go to web page
```
http://root-intercloud.av.tu-berlin.de:9090/login.jsp?url=%2Findex.jsp 
```
